The standard scalar is used to standardise the data and fit to give rmse less as compared to unnormalized data.

It is generally used, when the features are of different scales, when ```standardsclarer()``` is done, all features are scaled to same scale.

The plot of errors is as follows:

![plot errors](./Plots/Question6/q6%20bar.png)

The scatter plot is:

It is also used to provide numerical stability as well, so that computations are within range.
