The formula for normal fit is:
$\ normal fit = (X^TX)^{-1}(X^Ty)  $

The formula for SVD is:
$\ usv_t = SVD(X) $

$\ Î¸ = V_t^T  diag(s^{-1}) U^T  y $

# The errors obtained for each fit is as follows:

## For sklearn LinearRegression : 

    RMSE:  0.6207498618060853
    MAE:  0.5126346094502967
-------------------------
## For linear regression using normal equations : 

    RMSE:  0.6207498618060854
    MAE:  0.5126346094502968

## Time taken for each fit for over 100 times is as follows:
For different dimensions, times are as follows:
